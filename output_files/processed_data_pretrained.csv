user ill take this opportunity to also plead my case for one or both of the following
 adding the count  to at least the tooltip when hovering over a bar on a  chart especially in the dashboard view
 adding the ability to toggle between  and  in the   chart menu similar to switch to table view
it can be much easier to parsesummarize results when looking at relative s esp when comparing filtered results however it can be dangerous because of the law of small numbers as the sample size for each percentage breakdown is not available at a glance

user jack divita it doesnt actually make it work its still broken on the dashboard eg i removed a filter and the  didnt update on the chart which i toggled and updated

user jack divita looks like the reason it didnt update is because going into the chart making an update to it and coming back to the dashboard a couple times resulted in dashboard filters that were applied when clicking through to the individual chart ended up saving at the chart level as opposed to being treated as an ephemeral filter

07a7949c-1042-567d-9413-0b5b9def2ad6,"user hey matt miller  curious what this id field from enterpret is its the only optional available for syncing via census  is that something that was created when the bampb enterpret account was set up is it the email address

agent every record feedback user or account in enterpret needs a unique identifier in this case we are asking for an id that can tell us whether a row is new or existing this id can be anything  eg if you were using an export of data from salesforce you might use contactid as the identifier for users

user sorry not totally following  the instructions in census for selecting a sync key say that the column and field should have the same unique value  so i was assuming somewhere in enterpret there is an id field created for each record that is defined as their email

agent youre correct  when the sync ran for the first time and these rows were added to the user table in enterpret each one had its id field populated with the user email

user might be worth discussing live  it seems that for census to sync a record to enterpret there has to be a match on our source email and enterpret id and im not familiar with what the enterpret id is or how its defined it obviously matches our source email or no records would sync

user sorry i think i get it now  my first sync was an update or create  so those emails didnt map to any ids but they were created during the first sync

user matt miller we now have our census sync set to update only because we only want to send data for customers that have feedback in enterpret but if a new customer feedback is added im assuming we wont have the enterpret user id available for syncing via census does that make sense

agent im not sure i follow want to connect quickly to discuss

user planning to work on it today will let you know if i need any help thanks

user hey jack divita i still cant edit and save changes to the quantifies on the dashboard it will only let me save as new can we get that fixed

user im also seeing some weird filters or im not sure whats going on i havent even changed the dates yet to be for december but this is what im seeing thats messing with the data why does it say success  category and clm  category

agent emily nicklas i turned the dashboard into a template now if you click on the new dashboard button you will see this option if you create a new dashboard with this template you will have full control and edit access to the charts

agent gt but this is what im seeing thats messing with the data why does it say success  category and clm  category
this is because this is the technical name of the field coming from zendesk

user thank you for the instructions on creating a new dashboard
re the other thing im confused because the field name isnt matching what the quantify is about clm  category is showing as the field but the quantify is about clickwrap category how did that happen
and the data is different from when i pulled the nov data in december i know that there are usually a few tickets that get updated but when i pull the exact same things i pulled last month with the same exact filters i get wildly different results
for example i pulled clm top  categories with case reason  technical issues for nov  last months was screenshot  when i pull the same today i get screenshot  and if i change the field from success  category to clm  category its even more off screenshot 
happy to set up a call to go over these if we need to

agent emily nicklas this should not be happening i suspect that there are mismatching filters at play
can we find some time to go through this live together sometime tomorrow here is my calendar link if that helps with scheduling

user cc omar guerrero

agent its on the roadmap though no timeline planned at this point we have analyzed conversations handled by forethought for quite a few of our other customers though
interestingly i have seen some inconsistency in the implementations do all of your forethought conversations get sent to zendesk or only the ones that get handed off to a human agent

user only the forethought convos that get handed off to a human get sent to zendesk interested in getting all forethought conversations into enterpret for analysis though

agent we need to figure out how to get that data out of forethought then historically we have analyzed this data through a csv extract that their reps have shared with us
i will restart the convo on our side do you know if they are offering an api that would allow you to get all of your conversations into your instance of snowflake

user they offer this as an out of the box integration ill ask them about what apis they have available we dont yet have forethought hooked up to anything

agent i suspect that will be the best route for us given that you are sending us all of your zendesk tickets through snowflake and not from zendesk directly

the feedbacks are ingested at around jan  because the createdat field values are just year but are required to be unix timestamps
 to quantify

can the field values be fixed to have timestamp and resynced ive turned on mutability on our end so we would ingest the updated feedbacks

we can definitely do this type of analysis

user thanks jack that would be a huge help would it be possible to create this analysis by monday sorry for the tight turnaround

agent oh

agent you didnt want it right now wink


agent  this is a good first draft  but since weve got a lot of time we can spend some time digging in and highlighting trends over time and specific quarters etc
take a first look and let me know your thoughts  we can make it better tomorrow

user amazing thanks jack well take a look and share our feedback

user hey jack divita if we want to ingest more chats into enterpret what would you need is it just the chat id and transcript

agent almost all we need is
 chat id
 transcript
 date of conversation
other metadata on who the user is is always useful but what is typically most useful is being able to do analysis that shows
 these are the tickets that the chatbot is good at solving on its own
 these are the tickets that the chatbot had to pass along to a human
 these are the tickets that only went to a human
it is not exactly clear to me how we separate the tickets into these buckets is it safe to assume all of the tickets in  are the ones from the csv how do we know which ones are in 

user thanks do you happen to know what the last chat date we previously uploaded im also considering just taking feb onward we turned off the buttons so this data would probably give us better info on what customers are asking
 we dont have a good way for checking this now the csv will include all chats including escalated to a human
 if the chat escalated to an agent well have a ticket id that i can add to it however a ticket is also created if the customer goes through the feature request language intent or the customer indicates at the end the bot resolved their issue 
 a theres also a deflect tag but this would also include dropoffs which could account for a majority of the chats

agent gt do you happen to know what the last chat date we previously uploaded im also considering just taking feb onward

agent i think all would be useful because we have all types already coming in from gong
basically this is what we want to do right now for all the gong calls coming in we have the opportunity stage  at the time of the call some of these calls go on to be won opportunity and some go on to be lost but we currently do not have the data to know which is which
when you share the list of closedlost opportunities we will update the gong records so you will be able to see the stage at the time of the call as well as the eventualfinal stage of the opportunity this will allow us to show you the differences in trends between opportunities that were won vs lost

user sure  please see attached i have excluded anything that was a trueup type  expansion as these are essentially billing events and not true deals this will include our new biz lands renewals and addons

agent shelley lee any chance you could export these with the  digit case safe id instead of the  digit one

agent gt no one was able to access it though am i missing something or do they all need to have licenses
anyone at notion can have access to enterpret  we do not charge by the license and there is no limit to the number of licenses
but they would need a user in order to access the dashboard were they getting an error when trying to sign up

agent oh  i forgot we configured sso to be required to login
jeremy bui kayla eliaza can you remind me how users get access to enterpret through sso

user oh if they need to be provisioned for enterpret in our identity provider we use okta and have the tile in okta for enterpret theyll have to go through it

user yep thats correct they just need to submit a request iwth it and we can approve it

agent elliya cutler if you could share a description or screenshot if possible of the errorpage they were running in to when trying to sign up would be helpful we should be making it more clear on our side the they need to use sso

yes we do refreshes every two weeks in order to capture insights from new product releases and trends from your users

nooooooo sweatsmile think of it more like weeding your garden than pushing your stone
you are correct in that technically the list will continue to grow over time but i promise you that merging reasons together is incredibly high leverage to improve the quality of your instance and we are actively investing in better tooling to learn from the types of merges you make along with better automated deduplication

user oh boy i appreciate the reframe but it sure feels like pushing a stone right now sweatsmile

agent yeah thats fair
i would be happy to help andor hear your feedback on what is time consuming about it today  we want to make this process easier

user  the wait time to see the changes reflected in the dashboard isnt great since i feel like i still see the clutter while it processes on the backend its helpful that they turn grey
 the prediction of which reasons to merge is quite good the search works well and having both the search and the prediction feels quite effective
 there are so many reasons that have only been applied to  ticket and which have very subtle name differences eg help inviting members vs help inviting members in notion vs help inviting members in notion workspace maybe for some products this would be a helpful distinction but some concept in the model of everything is going to be part of notion or part of a notion workspace you do not need to differentiate between these concepts could go a long way
 sometimes the customers dont use the same words as we would to describe a feature we get reasons with their wording and with our wording ive merged some of these to use our wording but i have a feeling that more will keep popping up with the customers wording would be great to clearly indicate these sorts of conversations are actually all about this concept  label the reasons accordingly our clearest example is for a feature called allowed email domains which lets users automatically join a notion workspace as members in tickets this mostly shows up as complaints about i tried to add  as a guest but they popped into being a member how do i fix it and the reason is called something like issue with unexpected guest adding behavior when im reviewing the dashboard i need to understand that our product is behaving properly and these are not bug reports ive relabeled for now to be more like help understanding allowed email domain feature since thats a category that will make more sense for our product teams

78bcb62b-a253-5b80-ba3a-ee4ae94d9104,"agent from zachariah ooi it would be helpful to have have the gong call brief blurb on gong records in enterpret looks like its available through the vcallsextensive endpoint

agent hmm should we pull in what gong offers vs build our own call summaries

agent shortterm pull in their brief
longterm i dont have strong feelings about this but not sure id give it high priority

agent we have sources where we wouldnt get this call brief and the audiovideo integration should work in the similar manner to both also i feel organising it as chapters rather than a brief is better as one can get the brief by looking at the chapters and chapters can be become snippets have their own summaries  which we can tag feedback on wdyt

agent okay looks like we are already using that endpoint and are already pulling in fields from content 

agent  we have sources where we wouldnt get this call brief and the audiovideo integration should work in the similar manner to both also i feel organising it as chapters rather than a brief is better as one can get the brief by looking at the chapters and chapters can be become snippets have their own summaries  which we can tag feedback on wdyt
agreed about adding value for other audiovideo sources i think this could be a nice upgrade but with gong still the primary call source customers use i think wed need to be convinced that we could deliver something higher in quality and usability than them

agent why does zachariah ooi want call brief in enterpret

agent gt why does zachariah ooi want call brief in enterpret
because its a useful way to catch up on  remember the overall content of the call call title can help with that but if its a recurring meeting less so

agent mockup it would probably need a special place on the feedback card

agent another way to think about it  if there is useful data available from the source integration why wouldnt we want to ingest it

agent what if next feature request is to ingest call outlines action items etc from gong

agent louise sellars the messages would be from internal users we would treat them as internal and wouldnt generate predictions from them but one approach that another customer came up with is to use zapier
 add a custom emoji to slack enterpret logo called sendtoenterpret
 configure a zap where any time someone reacts to a slack message with that emoji it gets sent to enterpret

2bcd495c-91a1-502b-a3ab-07bccc9cb5d3,"user hi jack divita i was wondering if it was possible to measure the sentiment change within a ticket for example does a customer start with negative sentiment but has positive sentiment at the end of a ticket

user do we ask for csat multiple times within a tickets lifecycle i thought we only ask it when the ticket is closed

user nope we only ask for the csat  hours after the ticket is solved for email twitter tickets will receive the csat every time the ticket is solved but we can adjust as needed

user nice is what enterpret calls sentiment different from csat i thought they were the same 

user i was looking at the customer sentiment throughout the entire ticket not their csat survey the thought behind this one is that wed be able to find tickets tickets where the support team turned the customers interaction around

user right so what enterpret calls sentiment is different from csat

user jack divita please correct me on this but enterpret user sentiment analyzes the customer sentiment through the ticketinteraction satisfaction rating will be the customers response to the csat survey

agent gt please correct me on this but enterpret user sentiment analyzes the customer sentiment through the ticketinteraction satisfaction rating will be the customers response to the csat survey
this is exactly correct

user thanks jack divita do you know if it would also be possible to track the sentiment change within an interaction

agent currently not possible but this is not the first time we have heard this request have raised it with the engineering team and there will be exploration on the feasibility in the coming weeks

user thanks if this gets added to the roadmap can you let us know this could be a useful metric for us

agent definitely
before being added to the roadmap we will likely have some follow up questions on use cases and specific examples any additional detailsthoughts you can share on those would also be helpful

user of course no problem
 positive gt negative
  does this lead to churn
  are there policies that are causing this change 
  these can also be used to identify coaching opportunities
 negative gt positive 
  identify tickets where an agent did an good job can be used to improve training or feedback for the agents

agent gt  does this lead to churn
this one is doable today without analyzing intraticket sentiment changes we just need a little more data from notion

agent meaning  if you tell me which of your users churned and when i can tell you what problems they had before churning and how those compared vs users who have not churned
this is a very common use case today

user in order to tell you which users have churned and when wed probably have to pull subscription changes in from stripe which is managed by my team jack divita do you have any additional information about howwhat youd need from us to get churn data into enterpret i can ask my engineers if they have time for it

agent the only thing i need is something to join it agains the feedback record for zendesk it looks like we have user email unique user id workspace id external user id for gong we have workspace id user id and email for forethought all i have is a record id
i would also recommend including other additional metadata that might be useful for analysis sign up date churn date churned arr number of seats churned etc

here is a link to the first iteration of the dashboard to help with this i added some filters to the charts to try and highlight reasons that to me seemed actionable 
a couple of highlights that stood out to me
 the ability to search through contracts comes up in lost deals twice as often as won deals
 redlining documents comes up x as often in lost deals
 setting reminders for contracts comes up x as often in lost deals
 a clause library comes up x as often in lost deals
 ocr on contracts seems is also a common one on lost deals
i am imagining this as an iterative process where we can continue to drill in to some of these reasons to make them more specific and further filter the list so it is as useful for you as possible

confusion over developer mode access rights
users have reported various issue with development mode access  records  including mistakenly granting access to the wrong user  being unable to give dev mode access to another user  and their developers losing access to the mode  some users access level was not sufficient for the dev mode feature to work  even after the issue was resolved users were unable to regain access to their previous full dev mode

user i always thought the citation numbers represented counts of records thinkingface 

user that would be a very nonstandard usage of the citation format  if theyre meant to represent counts i would strongly ask that they not use the standard citation format which pretty much universally means specific link to single resource something like x records the way it appears at the top would work for counts

user molly jane nicholas is this how ivy league presidents get fired lol

as weve talked about before we dont have the administrative time to clean them up disappointed

agent gt a reason thats still tracking new feedback records even though its out of date
tanner hopkins can you share more about this

user yeah we have a reason associated with customers who want a mobile app well we have a mobile app but feedback is still getting assigned to it even though we have a mobile app

agent hi tanner hopkins got it here is what is happening  the reason ability to have a mobile app has a few different definitions that have wrongly been grouped together i will clean this up and move the incorrect ones elsewhere we are actually working on some automated approaches to detect issues like this since it is emerging as an issue for many customers cc arnav sharma

user thanks yeah i know how to clean it up but thinking more broadly this is just one example of many reasons that are wrongout of date that require a lot of time to maintain as weve talked about before

agent we do have some ways we might be able to go about this seth harris what is the source of these posts

user hey sorry for the slow response been heads down on the multi edit launch today

user a good example is feedback we saw from the recent prototyping bundle launch
 i just want scroll interactions and cursor effects
 is there a reason why only the pixel  model is offered but not the pixel  i know you cant cover all android devices but if you already support pixel why not the lastest models would be great if there is the same selection for frames slightlysmilingface
 gonna need some more android device options my dude lets get some pixels in there
haha nice work though
 still waiting for zindex for components with variants with floating elements inside autolayout
 but when you set the height to  smart animate does not work for height animations
 hope once you will add different timelines for different layers to make sequential transition animations
 what about adding folders to the pages pane that seems to be more highly requested than these micro improvements sweatsmile
what about setting default assets to projects  teams so i dont have to add them with every new file
 aspectratio lock for images is next
 record mode would be nice addition
 really to much good but when you will add also screen record feature
 could you please make this exportable as a png its so frustrating working with mockup frames from the community sometimes
 any possible way to have the time signal wifi and battery indicators automatically added when previewing on the device
provides a more true preview
 amazing a quick wish from here if i would be able to pull the preview out of the app window and onto another screen it would be sick then it would not be interfering with my design yea sure i can open a new figma window but thats not the same d

user yep

user landon howa is this the normal process request via opal is there no way to autoapprove anyone that wants to access enterpret via a link

user fwiw opal autoapproved my request so it was quick

user hey michael like alex mentioned this is setup to auto approve if you are an fte already just have to go to the link and hit request slightlysmilingface  its possible to autoassign to specific departments for example so they dont have to request but this may be overkill if not everyone needs access

b5099fff-a377-5346-8e09-4ca0433cfcb1,"user hey jack divita and enterpret team madison kohls is making changes to our zendesk model upstream from enterpret are there additional steps or changes you guys need to make to ensure it flows through the platform properly starting a thread

agent it depends
can you share more detail on the changes

user we appended new columns to the table we sync over to you all nothing has been removed they are more metadata columns

agent shouldnt be a problem on our end and ideally the data should just start flowing over naturally
the only tricky part would be if you want us to backfill the existing data we have already ingested with the new metadata or to only have it populated moving forward

user backfilling would be great i backfilled the table on our end so curious how that would work for you all

agent its doable but i will need to get my engineering team involved let me check back with them to see what might be needed to get this done
when did these changes go into effect asking with the real intention of checking to see what columns were added to confirm i am ingesting them

user i believe yesterday

agent whats a new column i should look for

user ticketcontactreasontag

agent hmmm i am not seeing any data with that present yet but i think you havent synced any data to us today yet either  ill check back after the sync

agent madison kohls we have not ingested any new data with this additional metadata  because we have not ingested any new data since feb 
checked with my eng team and we are actually getting an authorization error for customerfeedbacktickets could this be related to the change you made

user let me flag this to those who supported my change

user i can confirm the dbt job has been running successfully and materializing
  of  ok created sql incremental model enterpretshareddatapubliccustomerfeedbackticketsmaterialized success  in s
while not very familiar with enterpret ui i dont see any error messages there either
we can loop in di if needed

agent is there anything that would have changed with the permissions or authentication in the last  days

agent for reference here is the article for how the integration works on our side


user i see let me check the exposures

user the table was recreated yesterday for the backfill so it seems likely that some permission changed somehow

user hi   i see the environment associated with enterpret uses the now defunct etl role see  could someone from di please replace the role in the job if that is in fact the issue and also update the ownership of the tables in question
urgency medium

user hi jack divita could you help me understand how i can find out the connection details user role etc from the ui

user michael wu do you happen to know how enterpret connection is set up

user it doesnt let me edit the configuration im guessing you can only see it on creation

user i was expecting at least an enterpret user and a role in snowflake but i cant find any

user on di side the credentials are created here 
these credentials work on a separate reader account created here 
and so if were to debug query history wed have to see the query history from within the reader account

user ah got it ill try there

agent gt it doesnt let me edit the configuration im guessing you can only see it on creation
i believe this is the case as well
i am looping a couple engineers from our side to help with this as well ideally we would be able to update the credentials of the existing integrations perhaps something we can do on our backend as needed thinkingface  because i would want to avoid resyncing the entire table
cc ishita mundhra vivek kaushal  can we help figma correctdebug this

user i can see the problem being not the auth i can log in with the same credentials and i see query history from today but theres only customerfeedbackreviews not the other one and that could be the problem

agent we havent seen any issues with customerfeedbackreviews just customerfeedbacktickets

user this is fixed now
the issue is that when a view is recreated the grant to the reader account is not applied automatically and theres no way to automate that future grants to shares are not allowed so as long as we dont manually recreate views well be good

user note for ds would be to inform di when a fullrefresh is performed for enterpret tables thanks peng wang

agent amazing  thank you all for your help i will monitor from our side to see when we see the data flowing again

user yazad khambata can we document this somewhere so we can simply point data infra oncall to the few commands they need to run

user i will ping you privately

dbe439c0-9530-5976-8318-3fc06b10bd1b,"agent hey team please find some feedback from float will add the gong call in the replys
thanks for your understanding on the call  looking forward to staying in touch
heres some of our teams verbatims from the trial
gt heres my early thoughts  questions on enterpret as im going through
gt  so it pulls and creates summaries from our customer feedback channels based on keywords we specifically tag or can it tag automatically based on the nature of customer feedback eg if were not tracking agency or billable hours it can still search  create a summary based on that pretty powerful if so edit it can thats awesome this feature alone will solidify amp finalise my agency positioning work raisedhandsskintone
gt  i love that the feedback summary can be created based on feedback from a specific time period last  months is the perfect preset for what im working on
gt  the sentiment analysis is brilliant too  being able to see  filter based on this is very helpful for answering questions about why people did or didnt switch to float  how were currently serving a particular group
gt  email subscription is a great win too as itll help centralise insights in a given period in one place so i can share them internally
gt 
gt 
gt 
gt 
gt curious to learn about its analytics and reporting capabilities  how confident do we feel we can trust the data and summaries it provides us especially if were going to be making key big product x marketing bets from this
gt  quantify  sum of mrr x feedback reason  this is gold showing the mrr impactchurn from each feedback reason is powerful enables us to build better features x marketing that serves our best fit customers
gt  segmentation is a key component here though would like to see how far we can drill into each reason and split it by market segment use case mrr etc
gt 
gt 
gt 
gt 
gt overall i think its better than what we have for sure based on its centralised customer feedback analysis features unsure how much it costs but i imagine its a lowtomid figure acv product based on the functionality on show here
gt 
gt questions to ask here to move forward from my perspective
gt  does it require someone to manually feed the model every week to continue getting good results eg building the taxonomy and merging reasons into perpetuity etc seems like a timeconsuming job for a poor soul sweatsmile
gt  how can we use it to help inform our product x pmm okrs like figma did at company level
gt  for queries that are hyperspecific and new eg timezones etc the data amp summaries it provides will certainly be more surfacelevel compared to items around billing allocations other core product features
gt  can this be replicated with a customgpt from open ai could we feed it all our data and have it spit out what we need
gt 
gt 
gt 
gt 
gt other than that i think its very powerful  we just need to set it up right
gt the summary inevitably endup me wanting to know more
gt 
gt example
gt  issue with adding project dates
gt the summary returned
gt the feedback on float indicates that users are experiencing difficulties when trying to add start and end dates to their projects
gt  confusion over adding project dates users have reported an issue with adding project dates
gt  they are unsure about how to find and set the start and end dates for their projects
gt  this confusion is prevalent among users leading to difficulties in project management
gt 
gt 
gt which is fine but of course gives me no context as to why or what they are trying to achieve
gt but i was also a little surprised to see only  feedback records over mth period thinkingface
gt 
gt i do like that it pulls in community slack records  would this act as a permanent store for this data that alone could be worth the cost
gt 
gt over in quantify
gt i tried filtering on keywords like google calendar and api  all  saw was a lot of support conversations which are not particularly useful to me
gt 
gt im still left wondering if our numbers are too small to be meaningful im concerned the summary statements are confidently expressed based on  or  pieces of feedback
gt 
gt also not really sure how this ties into a feature request system theres something appealing to me to know we have requests logged somewhere ideally with some product thinking notes jotted down but crucially with some verbatim comments from customers if this is going to reinterpret the results everytime and pull out maybe thats a good thing but its going to be hard to grasp what a request is
gt im impressed with the concept of searching for terms and then being able to filter results to get to a data set that you can then dig into if we are searching on the full range of user feedback from all tools as it looks to be thats very powerful and a huge timesaver right there
gt 
gt my main concerns are
gt  confidence that we are searching all data sources and not missing anything
gt  confidence that the ai is interpreting feedback as we would i found that when i put a csv of user feedback through chatgpt for rates and asked it to group the themes and tally them it struggled to do this as well as one of us would it was likely lacking a lot of context around the terms we use for the app industry terms and then oftentimes a word means something different in the sentence because resource planning calendar they can all be applied in very different contexts
gt  loe to keep it well fed with data and context who owns this
gt  how it connects to feature requests
gt 
gt 
gt on the last point connecting to feature requests could we import our feature requests list from linear and then have the ai link any relevant feedback to each request in enterpret then we could pull up a feature request in enterpret and see all the related user feedback including the customers that have requested it if we can then dismiss inaccurate links presumably the model can improve at making good connections
gt 
gt would be pretty cool if that is integrated so person adds a feature request in linear enterpret autolinks all relevant user feedback to the request in enterpret then its all their ready when we evaluate the request
gt looks pretty slick i was looking for feedback related to placeholders yesterday and it was very helpful
gt  its great you can open intercom amp gong conversations and have the relevant conversation part immediately available
gt  it did seem like we need to do some gardeningadd some data sources but im very impressed seeing this v experience
gt  the ability to search and filter by sentiment customercompany attributes like mrr is huuuuuuge raisedhands
gt  importing everything seems to create some noise eg i dont need to see all the feedback about payment declines but it looks like we can filter that out and create dashboards ourselves
gt  it looks like its importing intercom conversation tags which we could use to setup a process with cs to help here

 i see that you support user deprovisioning via an event hook and just wanted to confirm the oidc connection supports provisioning of some sort perhaps jit

generic sso configuration guide 
okta configuration guide 
okta user provisioning and deprovisioning guide 
gt  from the docs it looks like we can test sso with enforcing
yes this is correct
gt  am i able to give you the issuer client id and client secret or does it need to be an admin in enterpret from figma
i would recommend an enterpret admin at figma be the one to configure this currently your admin is michael nguyen it is also easy for us to give you admin access to configure this yourself if that is better
some context on this  there isnt much harm in enabling more admin users this is one of the few things governed by admin permissions today
gt  i see that you support user deprovisioning via an event hook and just wanted to confirm the oidc connection supports provisioning of some sort perhaps jit
my understanding is that this is supported on account of our other customers who are currently gating access through sso but i am not as familiar with the technical workings if this is unclear from the documentation i can loop in my eng team but i think this should work

user thanks jack michael nguyen are you okay if i am temp upgraded to admin to get sso configured

agent molly jane nicholas i dont believe you are ever sending us the zendesk ticket url you are however sending us the asana url for the govoc tickets as the metadata permaurl

this would need to be configured on your end to share this data with us

agent molly jane nicholas this looks like it is probably a bug with the summary message being sent to slack  since the summary in product and the examples there seem to be correct
would it be possible to share the full output from the slack summary here

user ooh interesting heres the slack output
heres a summary of the voice of customers with relevant customer quotes
users are experiencing confusion and dissatisfaction with unexpected charges for additional seats especially when collaborating with other professional plan users
 i found it really weird  
users are seeking refunds for unused periods and unexpected charges often due to confusion about the billing system
 is it possible to request a refund for ltdatetimegt since we werent actually using the paid features  
users are requesting assistance with account management tasks such as cancelling plans removing invoices and altering the number of seats
 hi i have tried to cancel my account but the instructions on your website havent helped i cant find the buttons you said to and then it said id get an email to say if i wanted to continue my subscription which i didnt can someone your end please cancel it and can i get the money refunded as i cant directly cancel the subscription and i dont have the money to be paying this subscription  
users are seeking clarification on figmas billing and pricing system including the cost of seats and the impact of reducing the number of seats
 hello i have a question on the amount of billing we have paid  in ltdatetimegt for ltdatetimegt subscription at this time we had  design seats in ltdatetimegt we had  design seat and  figjam seats so we lowered our subscription right  then ltdatetimegt i removed the figjam seats amp limited the deisgn seats to  and the dev mode seats to  why should we pay more then  what is the price of each seats and do we have credits since we lower our number of seats thank you for explaining me because i dont really understand the tarification and the add on to pay

 we have the professional ltdatetimegt plan still active

agent not sure why its not showing up in the ui when you click that section  i am raising that with my engineering team but if you search the terms from the query builder it will show up

specifically on zendesk we see a big spike in tickets on feb  see nd image but through enterpret it looks like theres not a spike until feb 
what could be driving that difference
 is there a day lag in when enterpret gets the tickets
 if not what else could be driving this difference
 does this only assess sentiment analysis on first contact or does each subsequent contact get a sentiment analysis
would love your thoughts on this jack divita

user molly jane nicholas do you know if the zendesk tickets are looking at ticket creation date or ticket resolution date

user laura perea heath rogers do either of you know the answer to the above

user kait schorr has been looking into the snowflake gt enterpret pipeline and might have a pov

agent this delay wouldnt be coming from our side that being said at a glance i suspect the root cause is that you are sending us the close date as the created date

user im looking into this more today ill focus on zendesk differences this is helpful

user im going to put together a doc of my findings for both sources and hopefully we can find someone to own it long term so we dont have the ambiguity around troubleshooting feel free to send me any details or weirdness youre observing

user fwiw my hypothesis is the state in which entepret ingest the tickets is different from the state in which zendesk is reporting the ticket dates

user the state of the ticket itself i think i remember someone maybe you mentioning that i will investigate that angle as well

user this is already helpful all it does seem clear that its related to the state and not some weird issue with incorrectly tagging so ill communicate that back to the team

user molly jane nicholas i dont know that was one of my questions norman lemke can you work with kait schorr on this

user the mode dash should be by creation date norman lemke to confirm

user so if enterpret is indeed close date it would be nice to switch that to match jack divita michael nguyen

user i would also be very interested in seeing sentiment on creation date and sentiment of close date to see if there was a change throughout the life cycle of the ticket

agent kait schorr when looking at the snowflake table there will be two date fields that are required by us for ingestion
 erccreatedat the creation timestamp of the feedback
 ercrowcreatedat the creation timestamp of the row in the table helps enterpret track what data to ingest
can you confirm that on your side the erccreatedat is being mapped to the created date of the ticket itself
here is the link to the full documentation of our snowflake integration if that is helpful


user yes looking now

user so erccreatedat is actually using the updatedat date of the ticket

user also the zendesk tickets are also being filtered by the feedbackprohibiteddomains table

agent kait schorr can we correct the dates we can help run a backfill on our end also is that the only filter on the table 
michael nguyen do we still need the prohibited domains filter
would it be possible to connect love sometime this week id want to make sure we are all on the same page and that any updates we make fully solve the problem so that we are not still working through this a few weeks from now 

user the filters ive found are these
userid is not null
ticket status in closed solved hold
userfacts domain not in prohibited domains

user one thing to note is we are in the middle of pulling data for an exec review meeting tomorrow so unless its a quick fix we should hold michael nguyen jack divita

user  madison kohls perhaps we can capture this request to change the erccreatedat to be the date the ticket was created not the updatedat date in your current doc of proposed changes to the query

user michael nguyen yup this seems to be from a model built downstream of the query i am proposing it seems like regardless we need to change the field from updatedat to createdat in this downstream model

user which query are you proposing changing madison kohls

user nvm norman lemke sent it to me we should definitely set up some time to align on this

user yes let me find a time for us michael and norman so i can give better context smile

ever since we integrated the zendesk ticket data we have seen a dramatic increase in the interest in enterpret from all of you figmates this week had really great training onboarding sessions with heath rogers and folks from your team and madison kohls as representation from the billing team
for anyone else who might be interested in getting started with enterpret i have included two links below that i think will be useful for you all first is a  minute overview video that will cover all of the basics of what you need to know to get started and second is my calendar link along with an open invitation for anyone at figma who might want to ask some questions and have more of a guided onboarding
link to video overview of enterpret 
calendar link to schedule personalized product onboarding 
i also wanted to highlight some ongoing work from our team
 molly jane nicholas has created some really amazing dashboards highlighting the feedback on the recent dev mode launch there are also a number of subscriptions directly pushing summarized insights to some teamspecific slack channels  this is exactly how we recommend taking advantage of feedback during product launches
  have a home page where everyone can align on the same data  trends
  automate pushing insights to slack so that people can stay up to date on whats going on without having to run their own reports allowing them to deep dive if they see something interesting
  to checkout her dashboard follow this link here
  
 there are some gaps in the zendesk data that we are working through all of the analysis you can do in enterpret will be correct but there is a chance it is not fully complete as we are not ingesting every single support ticket you can follow along with the progress in the thread linked below
  
 this week we launched the beta version of our chat interface called wisdom  this will allow you to ask questions and learn from your customer feedback through normal natural language as opposed to constructing a query through our ui
  i have attached an example of what this type of interface looks like
  if you are interested in participating in the beta product launch please let me know and i will add you

tldr  you can sync user  account metadata to enterpret to enable advanced reporting on customer feedback for example
 understanding the revenue impact of different reasons for feedback
 understanding root causes behind user churn
 understanding major causes for friction in user onboardingactivation 
the easiest way to set this up is to start syncing this data to us through census the documentation for setting this up is included below you can sync any type of metadata to us as a part of this sync the most important part is that we have a primary key that we can use to join against your existing feedback data from zendesk we are receiving a variety of different ids along with the user email but it sounds like the best one to use would be the notion user id  which we are receiving in two different formats which i have highlighted in the example below  these two fields seem to be populated on about  of zendesk tickets we have received in the last  months
enterpret record link 
zendesk ticket link 
external user id baafaacbbefbebb

 we need clarity on what data is being analyzed and even more importantly what data is not being analyzed
 we need to know who to go to when we want to make changes to the data model
 a from my conversation with the support team this week there are new dimensions of metadata that we would want to bring in
currently there are two snowflake tables that are being brought in to enterpret
 snowflake customerfeedbacktickets
  database name enterpretshareddata
  this is zendesk data
 snowflake customerfeedbackreviews 
  database name enterpretshareddata
  customer feedback reviews table name customerfeedbackreviews
  these are asana feedback tickets govoc
for both sources we are ingesting a value for ercid which best as i know represents the unique id for each record on the figma side based on previous conversations i know that we are not being sent every single record for each of these sources  but it is not clear what the criteria being used to determine what records are sent to us even if we do not change this definition i think it will be very helpful for everyone involved if we can atleast share this definition
i have included some analysis from my side to help with this investigation but ultimately we will need someone from the figma data engineering team to own this for the zendesk erc ids they appear to be sequential and make me think that you are sending us roughly  of tickets the asana ticket ids do not appear to be sequential
spreadsheet with extract of ticket ids 
who would be the right person to ask about this and to own this moving forward from the figma team is there any other data i can provide from the enterpret side to help with this

user hey jack thanks for putting this together i will hop in and help figure this out or at least hunt down an owner

agent amazing  thank you so much
please let me know if there is anything else i can do to help

user thank you so much kait schorr this is gonna be a huge win for us prayskintone

user looking into the asana tickets so customerfeedbackreviews and they arent actually incremental they are randomly generated unique numbers so the gaps between the numbers doesnt signify missing tickets the ercid is indeed the task id number though and you can only see it when youre using asana in the browser its the last bit of the url

user yup but see examples in previous threads where we are missing some tickets and we dont understand why

user understood im still digging into it just wanted to share that finding since the spreadsheet was calculating the jumps between asana tickets as well im looking at the queries and i will trace them from the source and see wherewhy things are dropping off

 fine tune taxonomy for more granular and actionable outputs
  now that the taxonomy is fully customizable i recommend we follow a thorough and systematic approach by tackling key areas one by one sequentially i am happy to help put in work on this front to help guide but i cannot be the one making the tactical decisions on reason definitions
  i will never know your business and your priorities as well as you all who would be best for me to work with on this front mitch louie should this be me and you
 nail down core use cases
  manjit toor i want your monthly support summaries to be as automated as possible using this template should get you  of the way there do you agree
  
 expand to more core use cases
  julia bendix i know there are other executive reports outside of monthly support tickets that you were hoping to be sharing can you share some examples of what those might be
 expand to decentralized insight production
  at our other customers we have seen voc have a lot of success by sponsoring dedicated enterpret training sessions with product support and operations stakeholders anyone who might have some use for customer feedback in their day to day we spend  minutes together and by the end of it people know how to create their own reports and find their own insights
  i think we should be aiming to start running sessions like these by late februaryearly march when we have spent some more time fine tuning the taxonomy
  julia bendix how do you feel about that timeline any initial thoughts on who some of these teams who might benefit most from using feedback first hand would be

had a brief chat with julio henriquez this morning and he confirmed it would be a useful dimension to include for analyzing feedback
if so i think it would be useful to include it in future sync also in order to avoid having to go through this process again and again are there any other relevant fields we should include at the same time right now you are sending us tier  arr  churn date  we have also seen other teams have success by syncing type  onboarding date  and geography  would any of these also be useful to include too
nathan yoon any thoughts on other dimensions the leadership team might be interested to slice the data by in future analysis

user hey jack divita  to get anything else added nathan yoon will have to submit a bi intake request as we dont have any dedicated enterpret support from bi for q and my current sprint is fully booked
nathan yoon when you submit the intake please provide a comprehensive list of the columns youd like to be added and to which enterpret objects
some initial clarifying questions can be answered here or on intake
 number of seats used  is this the total number of seats on the accountteam paid seats on the accountteam number of paid and active users or something else
 can you explain what you mean by type
 what level of granularity are you looking at for geography global region emea apac amer etc country something else

all in all he is very happy with the summaries direction as it is efficient for him to read multiple summaries and extract meaningful insights from that as opposed to rabbit holing in quantify land one nit that he had though was that feedback generally starts from x records but quotes show a very lesser number of feedback records y as part of summary where yx his expectation was that itd be aggregate validated xx

for taxonomy 
 keywords are very useful but there is a lot of keywords that are redundant or unusable due to being very broad in nature there is no capability to hierarchically manage these
 he was pretty gungho about reasons initially but found them to be too broad in many cases even if granular reasons are present they are not top of mind due to the attribution of records towards broader reasons being really up the pecking order
 he had heard from the team on parentchild relation of keywords and reasons as part of t wasnt sold on the idea but when i took him through the broad idea of customisable nodes which can have  to many relationship  he mentioned he was excited about the direction as this might reduce the noise a lot
 he would want this relationship to be autogenerated as admining the taxonomycleanup merges creations is something he hates as a pm and would ideally need ai to fill that gap
 he commented that currently reasons and keywords operate in a standalone manner but should be more contextual and mappable again not by humans but by ai
 he also mentioned that each feedback record shows a lot of incorrect predictions for categories even when he starts from a completely different keywords in place and this is misleading and erodes his trust on the tool ss attached

agent hi louise sellars two potential approaches
  total number of records that have complaints on them over time its broken out by source so you could do the addition offline or just take the zendesk figures
  a report on complaint reasons by week with a single record counting towards multiple rows if it has multiple complaints we dont provide a good way to aggregate within the app but if you export the table as csv it should be straightforward to sum it up
